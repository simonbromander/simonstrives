&lt;p>As a seni&amp;ndash;or user experience designer, I have expertise working with many types businesses to find solutions to issues and produce excellent UX. My daily motivation comes from guiding a group of people toward a single objective. I like to gather with others to generate ideas and work on problems(wether this being remote or in-person), while designating deep work time to concentrate on developing solutions and organizing future work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="my-experience">My experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ve worked with a variety of businesses, from start-ups to large multinational corporations, in the fields of fintech, HR-tech, e-commerce (B2B &amp;amp; B2C), enterprise ordering systems, and others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My prior experience covers all phases of the design process, from research and workshops to design systems and developer handoff. As part of my previous projects, I managed and took ownership of several design systems and scaled them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have project management and team leadership expertise. I’ve been in charge of a number of initiatives involving diverse business functions, business stakeholders, and customers. For team leadership, I have been mentoring and helping colleagues develop as designers. I appreciate feedback, and my leadership is open-minded and empathetic. I firmly believe that through working closely, leaders and their peers can develop together The process of learning from mistakes and improving oneself is a natural aspect of the development of any career. We should celebrate fails, learn and become better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personal">Personal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I passionately believe in the sustainability of a work-life balance over the long run and in the right to make my own decisions. I encourage my peers to focus and take breaks when needed in order to live up to this. In order to live up to this, I spend my free time participating in sports like cross-country skiing, running, swimming, and cycling. Additionally, I’m a food, wine, and coffee nerd. These activities help me refuel so that I can give my all at work.&lt;/p>
