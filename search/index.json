[{"content":"When Apple released the Apple Watch Ultra I was stoked, as a owner of prev Garmin Fenix 5 and the Forerunner 955 I wanted to try something new. I\u0026rsquo;m also heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, so having one less system to worry about felt nice. I was quite happy with my 955, except for the Garmin Connect app which felt clunky and old.\nI started out with my new Ultra and Workoutdoors app for recording workouts.\nPros:\nGreat customisations abilities for Workoutdoors\nBuilt in workout app works quite well, good integration with the action button, even if it can only mark laps and pause/resume at this point\nAmazing screen\nCons:\nI miss the physical buttons, the action button just wont cut it\nTrouble to load in pre-defined/structured workouts\nPairing a HRM strap is cumbersome\nCan not wear the watch over a jacket (hey its cold in Sweden during winter) without disabling wrist detection(and hence losing a lot of features)\nThese takeaways made me rethink my watch usage and I\u0026rsquo;m now back with Garmin 955 as my main training watch. I\u0026rsquo;m still debating with myself if I should keep the Ultra as an everyday watch. What I love about the ultra for everyday use:\nApple Home integration, turn on/off things within reach all the time\nSonos app Lyd for controlling speakers at hand all the time\nThe Remote app for controlling Apple TVs\nTimer app is outstanding and easy to use\nSleep tracking is great, accurate and easy to understand\nAuto unlocking my phone + macbook is a smooth feature to have\nSo, to wrap this up: After trying the Apple Watch Ultra, I returned to their Forerunner 955 I‚Äôm still considering the Apple Watch Ultra for everyday use due to its great customisation abilities, built in workout app, amazing screen, and integration with Apple Home, Sonos, Remote, and Timer apps.\n","date":"2023-02-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://simonstrives.com/p/why-im-abandoning-the-apple-watch-ultra-and-going-back-to-garmin-forerunner-955/images/watches_hu59eab96f298ddd121b762564044842ea_1679084_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://simonstrives.com/p/why-im-abandoning-the-apple-watch-ultra-and-going-back-to-garmin-forerunner-955/","title":"Why I'm abandoning the Apple Watch Ultra and going back to Garmin Forerunner 955"},{"content":"At first, I began jogging with the kids in a regular stroller, but this was only a temporary solution and I eventually decided to purchase a proper running stroller. Due to having twins, I had to switch my plans of getting a Thule Glide and instead opted for the Thule Chariot. This model has adjustable suspension and disc brakes and comes with multiple accessories, like the Bike, Run and Ski options. As the kids are still young, I also purchased the Thule Infant Sling to secure them.\nMy first impressions of the Chariot are that it is easy to maneuver when set up in running mode. The infant sling is great for our little ones (weighing 3.5kg and 5kg). Although it is not advised to run with a stroller until the babies can support their own head, I think running easy on flat roads being careful is not worse than walking with the stroller on a gravel path.\nThis stroller will be beneficial to my training regime, as it will help relieve my wife of some of her duties and also give me a good workout. It is a great way to get out and explore new areas, and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to the freedom and flexibility that it will provide.\n","date":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://simonstrives.com/p/first-impressions-thule-chariot-sport-2/images/thule-chariot-sport2_hu0b5def73e36c38306f077af9068944f5_4012022_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://simonstrives.com/p/first-impressions-thule-chariot-sport-2/","title":"First impressions; Thule Chariot Sport 2"},{"content":"It‚Äôs fair to say that my training volume dropped quite significantly since we got kids. A while back I felt anxious about it, but I‚Äôve gotten in to acceptance and now embracing it.\nFrom having almost unlimited time to train maxing out 15hours week to being able to train only when there‚Äôs a small free slot to do so‚Ä¶\nThis new situation led me to rethinking my training plan, instead having a training manifesto. The days of structured predictable training are over, at least for now. They will come back at some point, but now having a plan will cause me to stress more about getting sessions done than actually enjoying training.\nThat being said, this is my new approach to semi structured training.\nMain goal: IM70.3 Biggest weakness: Brick runs/running on tired legs Longest time spent: Bike With these prerequisites in mind, I wanted to focus on building my bike fitness and run. As going to a pool regularly will take too much time as a new parent i choose to just swim when I got the opportunity and it‚Äôs also the shortest time spent activity so I‚Äôd thought it‚Äôs better to build bike fitness.\nMy bike sessions are focused on building endurance and power, with a mix of intervals and long rides. I try to get in at least one long ride each week, and a few shorter rides on the other days. I also make sure to include some strength training on the bike, like hill climbs and sprints, to help with my overall power.\nMy goal for 2023 is to complete Ironman 70.3 in J√∂nk√∂ping. As of today I have not defined any expected finish times, but I\u0026rsquo;ll do that during the summer once my training routine settles and I\u0026rsquo;ll progress my training.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll post my updated training manifesto soon.\n","date":"2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","image":"https://simonstrives.com/p/how-getting-kids-changed-my-approach-to-training-and-planning/images/stroller-jog_hubeb7787005f59dc313fcc976c831bed3_251099_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://simonstrives.com/p/how-getting-kids-changed-my-approach-to-training-and-planning/","title":"How getting kids changed my approach to training and planning"},{"content":"I decided to start this site to log my training, adventures, race reports, share reflections and gear reviews.
