Are you leading a UX design team? Do you desire a greater presence of your design team throughout the company?

I've worked in a variety of teams and businesses, from start-ups to large corporations. I discovered a few things you can do to lower staff churn, boost team reputation, and make the UX team respectable.

**Transparency between the team and the organization is the key to success.** The siloing of the UX team from the rest of the organization is a common mistake that needs to be avoided at all times. The team and its members will eventually suffer as a result of doing this.

**Problems that will inevitably arise in a siloed design team include:**

- The team won't be taken seriously because they aren't privy to the organization's problems that need to be solved.
- It's tough to innovate when you're isolated because you're stuck in the backseat taking orders.
- Team members will eventually resign as they become mentally exhausted by company politics due to the urge to keep the design teams in their own safe space.

**I've previously worked on a team that was organized as a separate business unit and did not collaborate across departments.**  
  
It ultimately became unmotivating, which led to my resignation and a search for a better place to work. As a result, **I will now reveal what you can do to avoid this.**

## **Be inclusive, share your work, and make the UX team more accessible for the wider organization.**

By doing this, your team will increase organizational learning, increase feedback and input on your work, as well as encourage participation from others in the design process.

**Suggestions for having a more approachable UX team**

- Invite other organizational departments to participate in design workshops and feedback sessions.
- Make use of other business operations to increase the number of contact points with clients and users.
- Make _\[insert name of design tool here\]_ accessible to all employees so they can take a peak inside and see what’s going on.
- Proactively share what the team is working on and ask for feedback. Do this by actively sharing work-in-progress items; share early.
- Share your team's knowledge of facilitating workshops and learn others' how they can be better at facilitation.

In light of the above, I do not advocate disbanding the UX team as a whole, but rather view the UX team spaces as a secure place for discussing and providing input on UX work, with organizations and product/delivery teams handling the actual day-to-day work.
