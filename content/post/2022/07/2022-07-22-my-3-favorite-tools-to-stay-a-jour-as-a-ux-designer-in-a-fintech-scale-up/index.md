I love working within UX, every day I get the opportunity do work that actually impacts the daily lives of our users. I work as a UX Designer at [Minna Technologies](https://minnatechnologies.com/) building infrastructure for Subscription management.

And since I love doing what I do in a structured way, I have a handful of tools that helps me get organized. They have become part of my daily habit, and I recommend them to anyone and everyone.

The following are my go-to resources for helping me perform at my peak:

1. **Feedly:** I use Feedly to stay up to date on news and business trends. My reading list is automatically curated by the clever “Leo” bot based on intriguing news and subjects.
2. **Notion:** A database tool that “can do it all” is Notion. I’ve restricted my use of Notion to Collections, though. I assemble book lists, watch lists, app collections, and other things.
3. **Pocket:** For online articles Pocket is the best “save it for later” app out there. It syncs to my Kobo electronic reader and is simple to use.

If you end up using these tools, let me know what you think!
