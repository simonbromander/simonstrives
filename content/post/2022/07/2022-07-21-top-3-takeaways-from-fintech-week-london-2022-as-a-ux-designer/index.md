\- Wait, don‚Äôt you just sit around and fiddle in Figma all day?¬†  
\- Well, my role as a UX Designer in Fintech is a bit broader than that.. üòâ

When I got the opportunity to join¬†[Fintech Week London 2022](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/articles/growth-through-financial-inclusion.html)¬†as a part of my company‚Äôs product presence at the conference I wanted to take the opportunity to learn what‚Äôs to come in the Fintech space for product and especially UX. I‚Äôve compiled my views and observations from the people I met below. All from a UX Designers point of view.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Big Tech vs Big Banks**

In the coming years, we will see an increasing number of Big Tech services leveraging the infrastructure built by Big Banks to provide better User Experiences. Consider Apple Pay and Google Pay; they essentially use the rails established by Big Banks to provide even better and more user-friendly services.

**Reflections**

- When Big Banks no longer own the customer journey, how will this affect their business models, and will they even want to compete in the same space?
- Big Tech has no desire to build core banking services; rather, they would prefer to collaborate in order to use the infrastructure. How can the Big Banks profit from this?

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Embedded finance, is an opportunity to make financial services even more accessible**

When planning for the future, embedded finance is ready to be used right now. Embedded Finance is the integration of traditional financial services into services provided by non-financial organizations.

Embedded finance comes with:

- Consumer choice
- Consumer protection
- Frictionless connectivity
- Reduced costs for Consumers & Banks

As a UX Designer, I see opportunities in this space for identifying new pain-point patterns and use-cases where Embedded Finance can assist in problem solving.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription management for financial inclusivity**

When I introduced myself to the first two people I met at FTWL, they both told me about their recent attempts to cancel a UK newspaper. Their experience was dreadful, and they were eventually forced to call the Merchant and argue with a support representative about why they wanted to cancel. Why is this the case?

According to me providers of banking and payment services must cater for consumer choice and ease of use. The story about the dreadful experience of trying to cancel a newspaper enlightened me and made me reflect on that financial inclusion encompasses more than just making services available. According to a recent¬†[Westmonroe study](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/report/the-state-of-subscription-services-spending), 89% of Americans underestimate how much they spend on subscriptions.

With the rising cost of living and the past COVID-19 pandemic, getting in control of finances is the top priority for many consumers. Things like these accelerates financial exclusion, and increasing living expenses is a concern for approximately half of UK banking customers, with 45% saying their wellbeing has been negatively impacted due to financial concerns during the past year according to a¬†[study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/financial-services/articles/growth-through-financial-inclusion.html).

To cater for the need of more control of recurring expenses¬†[Minna Technologies](https://minna.tech/) offers services that help consumers to Cancel, Pause and change their subscriptions, right from their banking app.
