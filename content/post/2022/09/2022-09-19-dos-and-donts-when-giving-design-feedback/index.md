## Introduction

As a UX designer, I know that giving feedback is one of the most important (and challenging) aspects of the job. When done correctly, it can help my team members create better designs. But if I'm not careful, I could easily wind up hurting their feelings or sabotaging their efforts. In this article, I'll share some tips on how to give feedback effectively. I'll also touch on some of the do's and don'ts of providing feedback, based on my own personal experience.

There's definitely an art to giving feedback, and it's something that I've been working on for a while now. I've learned that there are some things that can help make the process a lot smoother. So if you're a junior designer who wants to learn how to give better feedback, then this is the article for you.

## Do: Critique the Work, Not the Person

When I'm critiquing someone's work, I try to stay away from personal comments. For example, I'll never say something like, "I don't like your font choice." It's not helpful, and it's not constructive.

Instead, I'll focus on the work itself. I'll ask questions like, "Does this font work well for the type of content you're trying to communicate?" or "What made you choose this color?" By critiquing the work and not the person, I'm giving the designer feedback they can actually use to improve their skills.

## Do: Be Clear, Concise, and Specific

As a UX designer, it's important to be clear, concise, and specific when giving feedback.

When I'm giving feedback, I like to use the "sandwich method”. This means I start with something positive, then move on to what could be improved, and end with another positive statement.

This approach helps me stay on track and makes sure that I'm not being critical for the sake of being critical. And it also helps the recipient of my feedback know that I'm invested in their success.

## Do: Make Suggestions and Offer Alternatives

I always try to offer suggestions and alternatives when I'm giving feedback. It's important to me that the people I'm working with feel like they have a choice and that they're not being told what to do.

I think it also helps them to understand my suggestions better and gives them a chance to weigh in on the options we're considering. Plus, it just feels like the right thing to do.

## Do: Be Prompt

Whenever I'm giving feedback, I try to be as prompt as possible. The last thing I want is for the designer to feel like they're being ignored, or that their work isn't important. So I'll usually send my feedback within 24 hours of seeing the design.

I also like to keep my feedback concise. I know that designers are busy people, and they don't need a long, drawn-out email full of feedback. My goal is to give them the most important things to focus on so they can make changes quickly and efficiently.

## Do: Acknowledge the Good

Here's a good rule of thumb to follow when giving feedback: always start by acknowledging the good. This shows that you're paying attention and that you appreciate the work that's been put in.

It also sets the tone for the rest of the conversation, which is going to be a lot more productive if we're able to stay positive. And who knows? You might even learn something from the designer that can help you improve your own work.

## Don’t: Make It Personal

As a UX designer, I've learned that it's important to keep my feedback constructive and avoid making it personal. It's easy to get wrapped up in our own opinions, but if we want to help someone grow and learn, we need to be able to offer critiques without sounding like we're attacking them.

There have been times when I've given feedback that wasn't very helpful because I was more focused on being right than on helping the designer improve their work. That is not what feedback is intended to be about. It's a tool to help someone get better, not to make them feel inferior.

## Don’t: Bring in Your Ego

I used to make this mistake all the time. I would give feedback, but I would also inject my own opinion into the mix. And what this would do is confuse the person I was giving feedback to. They didn't know whether they should take my advice or not.

It's really important to remember that when you're giving feedback, you're doing it as a consultant. You're offering your opinion, but it's ultimately up to the person you're giving feedback to make the final decision. This is something that I had to learn the hard way.

When you're humble and you let the other person know that you're just giving your opinion, it makes it a lot easier for them to accept your feedback.

## Don’t: Be Vague

When I'm giving feedback, I like to be as specific as possible. That way, the person I'm giving feedback to knows exactly what I'm talking about and can make the necessary changes. Vague feedback can be confusing and frustrating, and it's not going to help the person I'm giving feedback to improve their design.

If you're not sure what you don't like about a design, try breaking it down into individual elements and describing why each one doesn't work for you.

## Don’t: Be Late

One of the cardinal sins of giving feedback is being late(if feedback is given in a meeting). If you're going to be more than a few minutes late, let the other person know ahead of time. Otherwise, you're just wasting their time.

I've been on the receiving end of a feedback session where the participants was late, and it's not a good feeling. It makes you feel like you're not a priority, and that your time doesn't matter. Not to mention, it's just plain rude.

So if you can't be on time, make sure you let the other person know ahead of time. It's the courteous thing to do.

## Conclusion

All in all, giving feedback is a delicate art. You want to be honest, but you also need to be mindful of the other person's feelings. And above all, you need to be clear and concise.

The best way to give feedback is to start with the positive, then state the issue, and finally, provide a suggestion for how to fix it. This way, the recipient feels like they're being heard, and they also know what they need to work on.

Giving feedback can be tough, but it's a crucial part of the design process. By following these tips, you'll be able to give feedback that is both helpful and constructive.
