The design community is [in a rage](https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1570385551517437952). Designers argue:  _How on earth can they sell themselves to Adobe?._

In my opinion, Figma is doing nothing wrong. They were a venture-backed business, so eventually investors wanted a return on their investment.

Designers are scared of what will happen to their favorite tool. Will it progress to become something even greater, or will it get bloated and become worse? Whatever the case, there is nothing we can do about it. Let's embrace it instead.

**In light of that, here are my thoughts on the acquisition:**

- Former employees of Figma will create new businesses, hopefully around building **brand-new disruptive design tools**. This has happened before. Early startup joiners cash out and get the funds needed to build their own design-focused startups. I'm expecting some new shiny tools to come our way really soon.
- Adobe purchased Figma for B$20. It's not something to be ignored. As designers, we should feel proud of this. Businesses, customers, and end users all benefit significantly from design, and **this acquisition brings light on just how important design is**.
- But in the end, **designers must learn that their tools do not determine who they are**. Although Figma is a tool utilized in their day to day work, there are other tools available that are just as effective. New tools will also arrive. To all designers: Don't get bogged down by your tools; instead, invest in your skill set, methods of operation, and frameworks.
