UX designers and researchers frequently face the time-consuming challenge of interpreting and thematizing the interview scripts during user research. There are many user research tools that make thematizing easy and convenient, but they are often pricy and require a subscription fee. Notion Â can be a decent alternative since you might already be using Notion for free or your employer might already be paying for it.

I follow these steps when analyzing user interviews in Notion:

1. Begin by actually typing out your interview notes or transcripts. I use oTransacribe, which makes pausing and wriggling your keyboard back and forth while taking notes effortless ([http://otranscribe.com](http://otranscribe.com/)).
2. From the notes, make a CSV file.
3. Add the columns "User feedback(text)", "timestamp," and "participant identity" to a Google Sheet after importing the CSV file.
4. Establish the columns "User feedback(text)," "timestamp," and "participant identifier" in a Notion DB. This is where you start. Add columns for "Theme," "Sentiment," and "Context" as well. The context for the feedback will be included in the Context column, such as Onboarding, the Checkout form, etc. The "Theme" column contains items like "copy problems," "Color," and so forth. I utilize the "Sentiment Column" to record the sentiment of a comment; I typically use the categories of "Negative," "Natural," and "Positive."
5. Continue by copying the values from Google Sheet and pasting them into Notion.
6. Keep going over each row you imported into Notion. Including themes, topcis, etc. to complete your data analysis, go row by row. After row-by-row analysis of your data, you can start experimenting with Notion filters to look for recurrent themes and remarks. Learn about the basics of filters here.

To see a variety of patterns, combine different filters.
