It’s fair to say that my training volume dropped quite significantly since we got kids. A while back I felt anxious about it, but I’ve gotten in to acceptance and now embracing it.

  From having almost unlimited time to train maxing out 15hours week to being able to train only when there’s a small free slot to do so…


  This new situation led me to rethinking my training plan, instead having a training manifesto. The days of structured predictable training are over, at least for now. They will come back at some point, but now having a plan will cause me to stress more about getting sessions done than actually enjoying training.

  That being said, this is my new approach to semi structured training.
  - Main goal: IM70.3
  - Biggest weakness: Brick runs/running on tired legs
  - Longest time spent: Bike

  With these prerequisites in mind, I wanted to focus on building my bike fitness and run. As going to a pool regularly will take too much time as a new parent i choose to just swim when I got the opportunity and it’s also the shortest time spent activity so I’d thought it’s better to build bike fitness.

  My bike sessions are focused on building endurance and power, with a mix of intervals and long rides. I try to get in at least one long ride each week, and a few shorter rides on the other days. I also make sure to include some strength training on the bike, like hill climbs and sprints, to help with my overall power.

  My goal for 2023 is to complete Ironman 70.3 in Jönköping. As of today I have not defined any expected finish times, but I'll do that during the summer once my training routine settles and I'll progress my training.

  I'll post my updated training manifesto soon.
