I decided to start this site to log my training, adventures, race reports, share reflections and gear reviews. I’m an amateur athlete; runner, cross country skier, cyclist and swimmer. I have a background in professional windsurfing course racing.

As I start writing here I encourage comments and feedback on my posts. Looking forward to post here.

I’ll share tips and tricks, race/training nutrition recipes.

Some of my achievements:

🎿 Marcialonga x 2

🎿 Vasaloppet x 2

🎿 Birken x1 

🏃‍♂️Abisko → Nikkaluokta 110km @ 16h33min

🚴 Kattegattleden 407km @ 16h36min
