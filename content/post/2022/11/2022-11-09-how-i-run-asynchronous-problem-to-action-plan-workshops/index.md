I believe it's fair to assume that each one of us has, at some point in our lives, been in this situation: The team is having trouble getting things done because people are too busy with their own work to share ideas and make decisions. The task of completing the project has stalled. Do you recognize it?

If this has ever happened to you, you know how frustrating it can be. But what if there was a way to keep this from happening in the first place?

What if we could hold asynchronous workshops instead of waiting for everyone to be available at the same time?

In this article, I'll talk about some ways that teams can run productive workshops even when they can't always be in the same space.

By making workshops asynchronous, people can work when it's convenient for them and can join or leave the workshop whenever they want. We can avoid scheduling problems and still get the work done this way.

**Process**

1. For asynchronous workshops to work, everyone needs to agree on a clear goal and strategy. The purpose must be clearly communicated to the group. To make sure everyone is on the same page, I ask the main stakeholder to create a short video explaining:
    
    - Why we are working on this
    
      
    
    - Clearly stating the key user needs
    
      
    
    - What’s the expected outcome
    
      
    
    - How it will help to solve the problem
    
      
    The video is then viewed by the people who are in the workshop. When the participants watch the video, they are asked to make notes and pose additional questions which are posted on Slack and addressed properly by the main stakeholder.  
      
    

3. Once everyone agrees on the goal, it's time to get everyone together to come up with "How Might We's." I set up a short meeting for the whole workshop team (approx. 30 minutes is required)In a design thinking process, "how might we" (HMW) statements are a good way to frame problems. They are short, clear, and open-ended, which makes it possible to come up with many different solutions. (More about HMWs in a different post.) Using the notes that people made in Step 1, we work together to turn the problem that our key stakeholder described into HMW statements. At the end of the session, we pick one or two HMWs to focus on during the workshop. We pick the ones that give us the best chance of solving the problem.  
      
    

5. Now it's time to switch back to async. Based on the HMW that was chosen, I let each participant come up with ideas on their own. I ask the people taking part to limit their work to two 30-minute sessions.Giving everyone a set amount of time to work on a certain task is called "timeboxing." This could take anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes. When time's up, everyone moves on.The sessions should be at least a day or two apart so that people can have time to think. According to research, ideas are produced when you are not pushed to think of them. I've created a framework for participants to operate in so that they can work independently.  
      
    The framework is made up of three parts:  
    **Need** - Participants state the need that they are addressing.  
    **Opportunity** - Based on the needs, what kind of opportunity do we see?  
    **Solution** - What's the solution to the opportunity?  
      
    The steps and what needs to be done in each are briefly explained to the participants. People are asked to write as much detail as they can so that others can understand it.  
      
    Once everyone has put in their ideas, other participants will be asked to look over them and add comments. I set a deadline of 24 hours to keep moving forward.  
      
    At the end, we have a lot of ideas that we need to start organizing and deciding on. I set up another short (30-minute) meeting for the whole workshop team to go over all the ideas.  
      
    

7. So that everyone can understand, I've made a short presentation that goes over all the ideas. For each concept, I ask everyone in the group to vote.  
      
    **The vote is cast on a 5-point scale:**
    
    - 0 - I strongly oppose this idea.
    
    - 1 – This idea is bad, but it could be made better.
    
    - 2 - This is a good idea, but I don't see how it will solve the problem.
    
    - 3 - I like this idea, and I can see how it would solve the problem.
    
    - 4 – This is a good idea, and I think it could work.
    
    - 5 – This is great, it solves the problem, and it fits with the overall strategy.
    
      
    The votes have been counted, and we now know which concepts are the most popular. Now that we have a set of tangible ideas to investigate further, we select 1-2 to pursue. We start digging deeper into each idea by making action plans for each one. The action plans are then given to a driver, who is in charge of turning the idea into a project and putting the plan into action.

  
  
**Summary**

One of the best things about asynchronous workshops is how flexible they are. We can hold workshops with people from different teams, departments, countries and even time-zones. We don't have to be in the same room at the same time, so we can avoid scheduling problems and still do the work.

But there are some costs and benefits to running async workshops. Without face-to-face interaction, it can be harder to get people to feel like they are working together. It can also be harder to lead and keep things moving forward.

The steps I've described above have helped me a lot, and I hope they can help you too. You can use this guide as a starting point when you do run async workshops.
