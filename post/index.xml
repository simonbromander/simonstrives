I&amp;rsquo;m also heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem, so having one less system to worry about felt nice. I was quite happy with my 955, except for the Garmin Connect app which felt clunky and old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with my new Ultra and Workoutdoors app for recording workouts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pros:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Great customisations abilities for Workoutdoors&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Built in workout app works quite well, good integration with the action button, even if it can only mark laps and pause/resume at this point&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Amazing screen&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Cons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I miss the physical buttons, the action button just wont cut it&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Trouble to load in pre-defined/structured workouts&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Pairing a HRM strap is cumbersome&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Can not wear the watch over a jacket (hey its cold in Sweden during winter) without disabling wrist detection(and hence losing a lot of features)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These takeaways made me rethink my watch usage and I&amp;rsquo;m now back with Garmin 955 as my main training watch. I&amp;rsquo;m still debating with myself if I should keep the Ultra as an everyday watch. What I love about the ultra for everyday use:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Apple Home integration, turn on/off things within reach all the time&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Sonos app Lyd for controlling speakers at hand all the time&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Remote app for controlling Apple TVs&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Timer app is outstanding and easy to use&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Sleep tracking is great, accurate and easy to understand&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Auto unlocking my phone + macbook is a smooth feature to have&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, to wrap this up: After trying the Apple Watch Ultra, I returned to their Forerunner 955 I’m still considering the Apple Watch Ultra for everyday use due to its great customisation abilities, built in workout app, amazing screen, and integration with Apple Home, Sonos, Remote, and Timer apps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First impressions; Thule Chariot Sport 2</title><link>https://simonstrives.com/p/first-impressions-thule-chariot-sport-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonstrives.com/p/first-impressions-thule-chariot-sport-2/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://simonstrives.com/p/first-impressions-thule-chariot-sport-2/images/thule-chariot-sport2.png" alt="Featured image of post First impressions; Thule Chariot Sport 2" />&lt;p>At first, I began jogging with the kids in a regular stroller, but this was only a temporary solution and I eventually decided to purchase a proper running stroller. Due to having twins, I had to switch my plans of getting a Thule Glide and instead opted for the Thule Chariot. This model has adjustable suspension and disc brakes and comes with multiple accessories, like the Bike, Run and Ski options. As the kids are still young, I also purchased the Thule Infant Sling to secure them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first impressions of the Chariot are that it is easy to maneuver when set up in running mode. The infant sling is great for our little ones (weighing 3.5kg and 5kg). Although it is not advised to run with a stroller until the babies can support their own head, I think running easy on flat roads being careful is not worse than walking with the stroller on a gravel path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This stroller will be beneficial to my training regime, as it will help relieve my wife of some of her duties and also give me a good workout. It is a great way to get out and explore new areas, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the freedom and flexibility that it will provide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How getting kids changed my approach to training and planning</title><link>https://simonstrives.com/p/how-getting-kids-changed-my-approach-to-training-and-planning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonstrives.com/p/how-getting-kids-changed-my-approach-to-training-and-planning/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://simonstrives.com/p/how-getting-kids-changed-my-approach-to-training-and-planning/images/stroller-jog.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post How getting kids changed my approach to training and planning" />&lt;p>It’s fair to say that my training volume dropped quite significantly since we got kids. A while back I felt anxious about it, but I’ve gotten in to acceptance and now embracing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From having almost unlimited time to train maxing out 15hours week to being able to train only when there’s a small free slot to do so…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This new situation led me to rethinking my training plan, instead having a training manifesto. The days of structured predictable training are over, at least for now. They will come back at some point, but now having a plan will cause me to stress more about getting sessions done than actually enjoying training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, this is my new approach to semi structured training.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Main goal: IM70.3&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Biggest weakness: Brick runs/running on tired legs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Longest time spent: Bike&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With these prerequisites in mind, I wanted to focus on building my bike fitness and run. As going to a pool regularly will take too much time as a new parent i choose to just swim when I got the opportunity and it’s also the shortest time spent activity so I’d thought it’s better to build bike fitness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My bike sessions are focused on building endurance and power, with a mix of intervals and long rides. I try to get in at least one long ride each week, and a few shorter rides on the other days. I also make sure to include some strength training on the bike, like hill climbs and sprints, to help with my overall power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goal for 2023 is to complete Ironman 70.3 in Jönköping. As of today I have not defined any expected finish times, but I&amp;rsquo;ll do that during the summer once my training routine settles and I&amp;rsquo;ll progress my training.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll post my updated training manifesto soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I started this site</title><link>https://simonstrives.com/p/why-i-started-this-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://simonstrives.com/p/why-i-started-this-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>I decided to start this site to log my training, adventures, race reports, share reflections and gear reviews.
